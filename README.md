# Image-to-Ascii
Convert Image to Ascii using python

# Gray scale

# How to download
Go to where you want to download this file and type.
```
git clone https://github.com/Pleasedontforgetmypassword/Image-to-Ascii.git
cd Image-to-Ascii
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use the program
Open Command prompt.
Go to where the file is located, e.g (cd C:\Users\name\...\...)
The image you want to convert must be stored within the file that main.py, Image.txt, Ascii.py, is in.
The command you must type is:
`python main.py (specify if the gray scale is going to be 70 or 10 character's long) (Image name)`

# Example:
`C:\Users\...\...\Image-to-Ascii>python main.py 70 download.jpg`\
Or\
`...\...\...\...\Image-to-Ascii>python main.py 10 download.jpg`

# Errors
If a message like `Usage: python main.py (70 or 10) (Image name)` pops up, then you are using the program incorrectly.

# Note
The image to ascii program conversion, it is a 1:1 ratio. So bigger images will take a longer time and may look weird.

# Ascii Image
Open Image.txt and zoom out, you should see the image in ascii characters.
